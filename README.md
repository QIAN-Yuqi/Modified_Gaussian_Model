# MGM

Please see the original MGM website at http://www.planetary.brown.edu/mgm/. This is just for keeping track of my minor changes to the code.

## matlab
This directory contains the MGM MATLAB code that from the above website with a few minor edits. I fixed the program's ability to save graphs as TIF files and added the ability to save them as SVG files.

## startup_generator
This directory contains a few python scripts to generate the startup and asc files needed as input to MGM.
